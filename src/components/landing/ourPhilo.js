        The thing that sets man apart from the other animals is his ability to perform humane acts. As conservationists and humanitarians, we sometimes walk a fine line between helping nature and interfering with it. Our intention at Pacific Wildlife Project is to help animals impacted by unnatural events brought on by civilization. We do not judge or interfere with predation that is natural in the wild. Our goal is to give back some of what we take from the environment and to respect the natural balance between all living things.
